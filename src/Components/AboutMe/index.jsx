          Hello, my name is Temitope Babalola. I am curious and I enjoy work
          that challenges me to learn something new and stretch in a different
          direction. I do my best to stay on top of changes, as the world keeps
          evolving everyday so I can meet challenges with tools well suited to
          the job at hand. I am a great communicator and hardworking. I also
          enjoy working in teams as this helps to collaborate and learn from
          others. I have knowledge of some programming languages like HTML,
          CSS,Â JavaScript, SQL, React, Node JS, PHP, and ASP.net.
